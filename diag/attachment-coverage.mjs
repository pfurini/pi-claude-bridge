// Coverage scanner for attachment carry-forward (src/attachments.ts).
//
// The unit tests exercise shapes I thought of. This runs the real collector over
// every Claude Code session on disk and reports what it actually resolves, which
// is the only way to notice that the shapes in the wild are not the shapes in the
// tests. It found exactly that: the first implementation required an attachment's
// parent to be a user message, and 63 of 179 content-bearing attachments chain to
// another attachment instead — silently dropped, no test failing.
//
//   node --import tsx diag/attachment-coverage.mjs [--claude-dir DIR]
//
// It checks reconstruction, not just resolution: the session records where each
// attachment really belongs (`parentUuid`, walked up any chain of attachments), so
// the scan computes the answer from ground truth and compares. Verified to detect
// an injected off-by-one in the ordinal — which the text guard turns into
// "dropped" rather than a wrong position, the property that keeps a keying error
// from telling the model it saw a file at a turn it did not.
//
// Exits 1 when a carried attachment fails to resolve, or resolves to the wrong
// message.
